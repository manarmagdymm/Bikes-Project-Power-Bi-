increase in price = new price-oldprice / old price =0.25, 25% increasing
increase in demand the same way as price = 65%
price elasticity usually it's a negative number but in this case there is other things that play but i'ts pretty clear we can increase the price 
Price elasticity = the percentage change in demand divided by the percentage change in price.
This means that if the price increases by 1%, demand will decrease by 2.56%.
