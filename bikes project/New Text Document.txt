increase in price = new price-oldprice / old price =0.25, 25% increasing
increase in demand the same way as price = 65%
price elasticity usually it's a negative number but in this case there is other things that play but i'ts pretty clear we can increase the price 
price elasticity= increase in deman /increase in the price, and it is means that increase the price the deman will go down by 2.56 cent
