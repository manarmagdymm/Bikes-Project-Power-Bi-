This project analyzes a bike rental dataset using Power BI and SQL for data preparation.
The goal was to evaluate revenue, profit trends, customer demographics, and the effect of pricing on demand.

Key Insights:

- Revenue & Profit Growth: Total revenue reached $15M, with a profit of $10.4M over two years (2021–2022).

Customer Segmentation:

- Registered riders: 81.8%
- Casual riders: 18.2%

Peak Hours: Midday and early evening (10–15 hrs) show the highest sales.
Seasonality: Revenue peaks in summer (Season 3) with ~$3.2M.

Price Elasticity:

- Price increase: +25%
- Demand increase: +65%

Calculated elasticity: -2.56 (normally negative, but in this case demand rose due to external factors like increased popularity, seasonality, and customer loyalty).
Conclusion: The business can increase prices without losing demand, as customers are willing to pay more.

Tools & Techniques

- Power BI: Interactive dashboard design, DAX measures (Profit Margin, YoY Growth).
- SQL (MySQL Workbench): Data cleaning and preparation using CTEs and joins.
